# Study Studio Agent Guide

## What this repository is

`StudyStudio` — an Obsidian flashcard plugin for Chinese-first learning.

- Stack: TypeScript, React, Obsidian API, Vite, Vitest, `ts-fsrs`.
- Composition root: `src/core/host/main.ts`; React adapter: `src/features/flashcards/ui/FlashcardApp.tsx`.
- Hand-written source lives under `src/`. Root `main.js` and `styles.css` are generated from it — edit the source, never the artifact.
- Markdown notes are the authority for card content. Plugin data holds derived decks, learning state, settings, history, and continuity metadata.

## Working rules

- Reply in Chinese unless the user requests another language.
- Use Obsidian APIs for vault, view, settings, notices, secrets, requests, and Markdown rendering; do not replace them with browser-only assumptions.
- Preserve module boundaries and domain invariants. Read the guide for the area before changing behavior in it.
- After any code change, run `pnpm run build` at minimum. Report checks performed and any required checks or relevant manual verification left incomplete. Purely visual and styling changes need no new tests; behavior changes, including UI interactions, need focused tests beside the affected module.
- Use targeted searches or bounded reads for large generated and data artifacts such as `data.json` and `main.js`; never read them in full.

## Progressive disclosure

## Reference lookup

Use Context7 MCP to fetch current documentation whenever the user asks about a library, framework, SDK, API, CLI tool, or cloud service -- even well-known ones like React, or Obsidian API. This includes API syntax, configuration, version migration, library-specific debugging, setup instructions, and CLI tool usage. Use even when you think you know the answer -- your training data may not reflect recent changes. Prefer this over web search for library docs.
